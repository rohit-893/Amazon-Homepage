# Amazon-Homepage
Header: The header contains a navigation bar with elements like a logo, delivery location, search bar, sign-in option, orders, and cart. There’s also a secondary navigation panel with links to various sections like ‘Today’s Deals’, ‘Customer Service’, ‘Registry’, ‘Gift Cards’, and ‘Sell’.

Hero Section: This section seems to be a banner or hero section with a message about shopping on Amazon India for local delivery, along with a link to redirect to amazon.in.
Box Section: This section contains multiple boxes, each representing a different category of products such as ‘Fashion’, ‘Personal Care’, ‘Finds for Home’, ‘Amazon Gadget’, ‘Makeup’, ‘Pets Care’, ‘Toys for Home’, and ‘Fashion Show’. Each box includes a title, an image (the source of which is specified in the code), and a ‘See More’ link.

Footer: The footer contains links to various other pages and information about Amazon, such as ‘Get to Know Us’, ‘Make Money with Us’, ‘Amazon Payment Products’, and ‘Let Us Help You’. It also includes copyright information.

Please note that this is a static HTML page and does not include any dynamic functionality that you would find on the actual Amazon website. For instance, the search bar and sign-in options are not functional, and the product categories do not link to actual products. The images are also placeholders and would need to be replaced with actual images for the categories.

This is a good starting point for a basic e-commerce website layout. To make it fully functional, you would need to add backend functionality with a server-side language and a database, and enhance the front-end interactivity with JavaScript or a library/framework like React or Vue.js. You would also need to ensure all links and buttons lead to appropriate destinations.
